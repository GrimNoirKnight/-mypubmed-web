Authored by: Alan D. Keizer


Project Summary:

I want to create a ap on multiple platforms that will allow the user to search the NIH PubMed database (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for research articles.  The purpose of this app is to give the layman the ability to search for research articles and read the results in terms and languages that they understand.  The app will allow the user to translate and store the articles in PDF and web format so that the user can share the information with others via email and Safari in multiple languages.  We are trying to make it easy for the average user to find and understand peer reviewed medical research made available by the NIH.

Key Features:

1. The user should be able to enter multiple search terms. 
2. The default search term will be “Myelin THC” while we are doing development testing.  This search results in 38 articles found, which is manageable for testing.  This default will be removed before the app is released.
3. The application will list the Title, Author(s), PMID, Abstract, web link of each article found, and allow the user to select individual articles to view the PMID number, Title, Abstract, web link. 
4. PubMed article web links are constructed by appending the PMID to the end of the following URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.  So if the PMID is 3952806, then the web link will be: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39528076
5. The raw data of each article that the user discovered during a search will be stored locally on the device for future offline reference via the app.
6. The app will give the user the option of using AI to convert the Abstract to general layman terms in the following languages; US English, UK English, French, Mexican Spanish, German, and Farsi.
7. The app will store a copy all translated and original articles with the PMID number, Title, Abstract, web link. 
8. The user must be able to view both the original Abstract and the "Layman Abstract" at the same time.  The app will display the PMID Number, Title (Translated to language the user selected), Title (Original), Abstract (Translated to language the user selected), Abstract (Original).
9. The user must be able to create and store a PDF file of the original Abstract and the "Layman Abstract" at the same time.  The app will save the PMID Number, Title (Translated to language the user selected), Title (Original), Abstract (Translated to language the user selected), Abstract (Original), and web link.
10. The background color will be white (#FFFFFF).  The text color US Flag blue (#3C3B6E).  Other elements will be US Flag red (#B22234).
11. All text fonts will be Arial.
12. All text sizes will be 9 and 12 point.
13. Bold will be used for titles.
14. All .swift code must be verbosely commented for novice swift developers by the AI Chatbot.
15. The AI Chatbot will maintain and track comments and version number using SemVer (Major.Minor.Patch) development stages (Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate (RC), and Post-Release fixes).
16. The AI Chatbot will instruct the developer as to what to do whenever version changes need to be committed.
17. Initial testing will search for the term “Myelin THC”.  This will result in 38 articles found with the following PMID numbers:
18. The app will display all relevant identification numbers about each article.  The most common identifiers are:


* PMID (PubMed Identifier): A unique number assigned to each article indexed in PubMed. Helps in quickly finding specific articles within the database.
* DOI (Digital Object Identifier): An alphanumeric string assigned to digital content like journal articles. Provides a persistent link to the content online.
* PMCID (PubMed Central Identifier): A unique number for articles archived in PubMed Central. Required for NIH-funded research compliance.
* NIHMSID (NIH Manuscript Submission Identifier): A temporary identifier for manuscripts submitted to the NIH Manuscript Submission system until they receive a PMCID.
* ISSN (International Standard Serial Number): An eight-digit code used to uniquely identify periodical publications like journals.
* ISBN (International Standard Book Number): A unique identifier for books and other non-serial publications.

These identifiers ensure that various types of biomedical literature are easily managed and tracked.

19.  All web links for each article will be displayed and clickable for the user.
20. The following attributes about each article will be recorded and displayed for the user.  Optional attributes are attributes that any specific article may have:

//  Attribute Name          Type      Optional        Notes
//  -----------------------+---------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------

21. Below is a rundown of what we’re looking at—PubMed’s plain text “meta file” format is basically a series of key–value pairs. The “left column” (the keys) is made up of standardized abbreviations that tell you what each piece of data is. (And yes, the one you’ve explicitly listed is only the PMID, but when you grab the full “=pubmed” format, you see a host of these.)

Here’s a quick cheat sheet of the most common variables you’ll find:
	•	PMID
– What it is: The PubMed Identifier, a unique number assigned to every record.
– Why it matters: It’s your go-to reference number for tracking or citing that publication.
	•	OWN
– What it is: Typically indicates the “owner” of the record, usually “NLM” (National Library of Medicine).
– Why it matters: It shows who’s responsible for curating the record.
	•	STAT
– What it is: The status of the record, such as “MEDLINE” for fully indexed articles.
– Why it matters: It helps you know if the record has been processed through the full PubMed pipeline.
	•	DCOM
– What it is: The date the record’s indexing was completed (“Date Completed”).
– Why it matters: Useful for understanding the timeline of when the record was finalized in the system.
	•	LR
– What it is: “Last Revised” date.
– Why it matters: Shows when the record was last updated, which can be handy if you’re tracking corrections or updates.
	•	IS
– What it is: The ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) for the journal. Sometimes you’ll see more than one—often for print and electronic versions.
– Why it matters: It helps you verify the journal identity and sometimes even differentiate between formats.
	•	VI and IP
– What they are: Volume (VI) and Issue (IP) numbers of the journal.
– Why they matter: Essential for locating the article in the physical or digital journal archive.
	•	DP
– What it is: The Publication Date (“Date of Publication”).
– Why it matters: Provides the context of when the research was published.
	•	TI
– What it is: The Title of the article.
– Why it matters: Obviously, it’s the headline that tells you what the paper is about.
	•	PG
– What it is: Pagination—the page numbers where the article appears in the journal.
– Why it matters: Critical for citation and retrieval in the print world.
	•	AB
– What it is: The Abstract, a summary of the article.
– Why it matters: Offers a quick glimpse into the study’s purpose and findings without having to dig through the full text.
	•	AU/FAU
– What they are: “AU” is usually a list of abbreviated author names, whereas “FAU” lists the full author names.
– Why they matter: They give you the credit roll for the research and help you locate more work by the same authors.
	•	AD
– What it is: Author affiliation information (where the authors are based).
– Why it matters: Helps in understanding the context and sometimes the funding or institutional background of the study.
	•	LA
– What it is: The Language in which the article is written.
– Why it matters: Useful if you need to know whether you’re looking at an English-language paper or something else.
	•	PT
– What it is: Publication Type (for example, “Journal Article”, “Review”, “Clinical Trial”, etc.).
– Why it matters: This gives you an at-a-glance idea of the article’s format and content focus.
	•	TA and JT
– What they are: “TA” is the journal’s abbreviated title, while “JT” is the full journal title.
– Why they matter: They help with accurate citation and identification of the source.
	•	JID
– What it is: The unique Journal Identifier used within PubMed’s indexing system.
– Why it matters: It’s part of the behind-the-scenes bookkeeping that keeps everything straight.
	•	RN
– What it is: Registry Number for substances (often chemicals) mentioned in the paper.
– Why it matters: It’s particularly important for biomedical research where specific compounds are discussed.
	•	MH
– What it is: Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) that index the content of the article.
– Why it matters: They’re key for search and retrieval in PubMed, letting you find articles by topic.
	•	EDAT, MHDA, CRDT, etc.
– What they are: Various dates indicating when the record was entered, MeSH terms were assigned, and when the record was created.
– Why they matter: These dates help track the record’s lifecycle and update history.

A couple of notes:
	•	The URL with ?format=pmid is the minimal format (just the unique identifier), whereas ?format=pubmed gives you the full metadata including all these fields.
	•	These abbreviations come from a long-standing legacy system—think of them as PubMed’s shorthand that’s stuck around because it works, even if it feels like it was designed in a different era.

In short, every variable on the left is a field label that tells you what kind of bibliographic or indexing information follows. If you have a file that shows more than just “PMID” and you need a hand deciphering any extra fields, let me know which ones are giving you trouble, and I can break those down too.
